# LeetCode Clone

A web application for testing exercises, built using Flask and inspired by LeetCode.

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to test their coding skills by solving exercises. The application displays a list of exercises, and users can select an exercise to view its problem statement, write code, and submit it for testing. The application then runs the user's code and displays the result of the test.

## Features

- Exercise list with links to individual exercise pages  
- Exercise pages with problem statements, code editors, and submit buttons  
- Code testing and result display  
- User authentication and registration
